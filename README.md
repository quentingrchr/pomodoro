- Customize how long each timer runs for
- See a circular progress bar that updates every minute and represents how far through their timer they are
- Customize the appearance of the app with the ability to set preferences for colors and fonts

# Dependencies

This project is using a standard *create next app* boilerplate. I used *styled-component* for the style and *react-countdown*.
